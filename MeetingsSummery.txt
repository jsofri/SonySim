-global variable of symbol_table - list of unordered_map
-in general, we'll use unordered_map and not map
-try catch to each execute
-execute gets index and vector of strings
-arrow is one string, string (e.g. in "sim(") is without quotes
-we''l work with strings and not const char *
-using each command object multiple times, make sure we clean data   
member in advance (e.g. index_counter etc)
-mathematical expression is in one string
-curved brackets are not in the vector of strings
-no need for symbol table (weird)
-declare function = set an object that stores var name, index start,  index end, call function - replacing value of var and execute while start != end
